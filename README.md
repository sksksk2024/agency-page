## My process

### What I learned

I'm glad I completed this projectâ€”not because of its complexity, but due to the challenging image layout. It was initially confusing to implement, but working through it allowed me to learn from my mistakes and improve my approach to layout design.

### Continued development

I attempted to integrate parallax effects and smooth scrolling using Framer Motion but faced significant challenges. Moving forward, I plan to deepen my understanding of animation techniques to refine my skills before applying for jobs. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my grasp of Next.js alongside my MERN stack, as it significantly enhances SEO, performance, and developer experience.
